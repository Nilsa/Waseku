0.0 Introduction

wasekw-core is an interactive tool for ontogenic trees construction 
from hierarchical *csv and *txt files. It was programmed in Perl 5
using Tkx::treeview and hash tables as building engines for the trees 
set up. 

1.0 Getting Started

1.1 Installation

1.1.1 Linux 64

Linux/Unix users can compile the wasekw.pl in the wasekw-main folder.

pp -o wasekw wasekw.pl

* if not pp installed, run:
* sudo apt-get install libpar-packer-perl

1.1.2 Windows 64

Windows users can run directly the wasekw executable frog-icon.

2.0 Constrcuting the *csv files

The hierarchical structure of the in-files is stablished by tabs.
Resulting in a tree-like desing in a grid frame (text file).
For wasekw work properly no tab or spaces has to exist after
the text (node) is writen down.
